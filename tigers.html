                    <h3>TIGERS</h3>
                    <p>The tiger is the largest living cat species, known for its black stripes on orange fur. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates. Tigers are solitary but social predators, needing large habitat areas. They are endangered due to habitat loss and poaching. The word "tiger" comes from Latin and Greek origins. Taxonomically, there are two recognized subspecies: Panthera tigris tigris in mainland Asia and Panthera tigris sondaica in the Greater Sunda Islands.</p>
                    <p>The tiger is the largest felid species with typical feline features and a muscular body. It varies in size, with males larger than females. Tigers have retractable claws, rounded ears, and a skull similar to lions. Their coat ranges from orange to dark red with distinctive black stripes. They inhabit forest habitats across Asia and are solitary but territorial animals. Tigers communicate through vocalizations and social behaviors like grooming. They are carnivores, primarily preying on ungulates using ambush tactics. After making a kill, they drag the carcass to a secluded spot and consume it over several days.</p>
